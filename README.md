### Geoffrey Mantel's Public Repository of Random Stuff

Welcome to my repository. After years of private-only repos filled with personal tinkering, I'm starting the process of building out a public portfolio. This will be the code-and-papers repo. You can find descriptions of these contents, and more, over at my [public notebook](https://geoffreymantel.github.io/) page.
